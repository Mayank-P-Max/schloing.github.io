                        <p>Conclusion:To conclude, this page analysed the 3 different areas of social media and their impacts, suggesting that addiction to social media is likely to become the most common addiction within the next decade due to its large reach all over the world. Furthermore, the marketing of social media is largely found in Asia due to its high population density, providing the majority of social media usage is represented from that continent.Also, the negative effects of social media are already occurring within current generations and how it is causing more isolated individuals who rely on their devices to do any activities. But social media is not all that bad as it has parental controls that can easily be adjusted and they can be easily deleted. Social media has helped to unite the world and find others who are like-minded and all of these negative effects can be subverted from active parenting.
